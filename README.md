# SA2 Render Fix
Many graphical bugs, errors, and oversights have appeared in the game since its debut on the Dreamcast - and even that wasn't perfect! This, over the course of 2, possibly 3, rushed or careless ports, has left the game in a less than preferable state and it's certainly not quite the 'looker' it used to be.

Render Fix wants to, well, fix that! Bringing the game back to how it should look, and hopefully even better! The scope isn't just fixes either, restorations are on the table too, as well as some enhancements - as long as said enhancement fits right in with the rest of the vanilla game.

## Installation
Install Render Fix into your mod list, either manually or via the '1-Click Install' feature. Then enable it and, using the arrows on the right, move Render Fix all the way to the top of the list. Render Fix should always come first before any other mod. After that, just play and enjoy! And remember to check for updates!

## Making New Issues
If you know of an issue that can be fixed by this mod, please feel free to make a new GitHub issue after checking it's not already been made. But remember, it's one issue per GitHub issue. Any issues after the first will be ignored, please make seperate entries for the others.
